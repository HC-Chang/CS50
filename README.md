# CS50 - PSET - Practice - Windows Environment
		In Windows Environment, parts of the functions are different from Linux.
	I replace some functions, which are similar to origin ones, in this practice code to fit Windows.
	Rememer to include the library "CS50.c" & "CS50.h", if you try to code in Windows.
